### Hey! Computer Science student looking to increase my skills and knowledge.

I have almost 9 years worth of projects and mini-tasks I need to upload to GitHub so hopefully I'll find the time to commit them all  C-:

I'm more focused on Python and SQL, with a couple years of experience in both but I am always looking to expand my expertise.
